# Vibe_Coding
This repository is now organized as a **multi-project workspace** for all your vibe coding projects.

## Projects

- `NetworkApp/` – Python GUI app for network scanning, IP lookup, and script queue execution.
- `Stock_Tracker_app/` – Single-file Flask browser app for S&P 500 tracking and stock news.

## Adding future projects

Create a new top-level folder per project, for example:

```text
Vibe_Coding/
├── NetworkApp/
├── Stock_Tracker_app/
├── AnotherCoolApp/
└── ...
```
